Heisenbugs
	Non-monotonic edge introduced by R-C probe breaks some digital system
	Crystal oscillator horribly loaded, or stops entirely, by R-C probe
		add R between XO and crystal on test board to reduce margin to make sure this happens
		maybe compare relative freq of 32 kHz RTC and external crystal?
	500R transmission line probe breaks I2C

Characterizing an unknown probe??
	Pico TA061
	500 ohm DC loading (transmission line probe)
	Lots of overshoot/peaking
	Huge input C (as transmission line probes go)

Test board
	STM32F031 w/ external crystal
	DS125DF111 (retimer, but also does 10G PRBS generation)
	Test point on buffered MCU clock output for crystal output
	Figure out some way to inject power supply noise into an oscillator (ring)
		SMA noise input AC coupled into rail, drive from SSG
	I2C I/O expander + LED blinky
	Some kind of noisy thing you can use an EM probe on
